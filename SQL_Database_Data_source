Major League Baseball is a professional baseball league, where teams pay players to play baseball. 
The goal of each team is to win as many games out of a 162 game season as possible. Teams win games by scoring more runs than their 
adversary. In principle, better players are costlier, so teams that want good players need to spend more money. 

Teams that spend the most, frequently win the most. So, the question is, how can a team that can't spend so much win? 
The basic idea that Oakland (and other teams) used is to redefine what makes a player good, i.e., figure out what player 
characteristics translated into wins. Once they realized that teams were not really pricing players using these characteristics, 
they could exploit this to pay for undervalued players, players that were good according to their metrics, but were not recognized 
as such by other teams, and therefore not as expensive.

The project validates this relationship by exploring and analyzing the data, does their any actual relationship between payroll of the players
and the team's winning probability. Also was there anything anamoly when OAK team won in 2000 to 2004.
